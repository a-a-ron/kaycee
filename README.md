# Kaycee's Instagram Photos/Videos

I heard that some of you were wanting to get some of Kaycee's instagram photos for creating photo books. Since we don't have access to her account, some of you were using screen shots from her account to get the photos. I wanted to provide a better approach, one that wouldn't decrease the pixel qualily of the photos but rather a copy of the exact images or videos from her account. There are a couple steps you need to follow in order to clone this data to your computer but it's not too hard and will result in everything she has ever posted to instagram (photos and videos). You can then filter through the photos and keep what you want and disregard what you don't want.

## Instructions on how to get the Photos to your MAC computer

### Downloading Git on your computer

Github is a place mainly used when software developers publish and store code for others to use or contribute to. Git is a version control system that tracks versions of code, text, or whatever, and makes it easy for others to track the history and progress of the project.

Since the purpose of this repository is to simply download the photos and not contribute back to the project, you only need to download Git on your computer. Don't worry, this isn't any large software download. In fact, it's really just enabling Git from Apple's developers tools on your computer, something every Apple computer would come previsouly downloaded but they figured that not everyone that uses their computers would write code or use Git, so they left it out but made it easy to enable. 

#### Step One

Create a folder on your desktop - For example purposes, i'm going to call the folder `kaycee`, but you can name it whatever you want and just use that name in place of where i use `kaycee`. Once you create the folder to store the images, move on to step 2.

#### Step Two

Open up terminal on your computer - If you don't know what "terminal" is, that's Ok. You've probably never used it before. It's a way to issue commands to your computer. To open terminal, you can go to Applications > Utilities > terminal, or, hit "command + spacebar" to bring up a search on you computer and search for "terminal". 

#### Step Three

Copy and past this into terminal `cd desktop/kaycee/` and then hit enter. Then copy and paste this into terminal `git clone https://github.com/a-a-ron/kaycee.git` and then hit enter - The command will attempt to copy the images into the folder you created on your desktop but will fail becasue you don't have "Git" installed. You will be prompted to download Git from the command line tools, click install.

#### Step Four

Once Git has been downloaded, copy and paste this `git clone https://github.com/a-a-ron/kaycee.git` again in your terminal and then git enter - A few lines of information will appear on the terminal screen and the information will be downloaded into the file you created on your desktop.
