# Kaycee's Instagram Photos/Videos

I heard that some of you were wanting to get some of Kaycee's instagram photos for creating photo books. Since we don't have access to her account, some of you were using screen shots from her account to get the photos. I wanted to provide a better approach, one that wouldn't decrease the pixel qualily of the photos but rather a copy of the exact images or videos from her account. There are a couple steps you need to follow in order to clone this data to your computer but it's not too hard and will result in everything she has ever posted to instagram (photos and videos). You can then filter through the photos and keep what you want and disregard what you don't want.

### Downloading Git on your computer

Github is a place mainly used when software developers publish and store code for others to use or contribute to. Git is a version control system that tracks versions of code, text, or whatever, and makes it easy for others to track the history and progress of the project. 

Since the purpose of this repository (project) is to simple download the photos and not add anything back, you only need to download Git on your computer. Don't worry, this isn't any large software download. In fact, it's really just enabling Git from Apple's developers tools on your computer, something every Apple computer would come previsouly downloaded but they figured that not everyone that uses their computers would write code or use Git, so they left it out but easy to enable.
